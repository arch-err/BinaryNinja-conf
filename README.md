# BinaryNinja Configuration and Installation

## TL;DR
Based off of my setup I've made this script that should download the latest version of binaryninja, add my custom configuration, and create a `.desktop` file
!> [!WARNING]
> This is ONLY tested on my own setup. I try not to be dumb, so this script should work on most linux-based systems, but I won't test it. As long as it works on my machines using my setups I'm happy.

```bash
curl .../setup.sh | sh
```
